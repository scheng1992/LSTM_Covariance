# LSTM_Covariance
The code of Lorenz system and Shallow water model are saved seperately in this repertory. For each application, the code includes

1. simulation of the dynamical system
2. data assimilation code
3. D05, D01 covariance tuning algorithms
4. LSTM covariance prediction (including data generation)
